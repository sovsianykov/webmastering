                         Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
                        superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
                        as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since
                        there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming
                        to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but
                        Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.</p>

                        <div class="articleImg">
                            <img src="img/detail/img2.png" alt="">
                        <div class="ban">
                    <h3>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
                        entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-line</h3>
                        </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                        The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you
                        would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty
                        yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so
                        that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length,
                        the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred
                        fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub,
                        not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
                        cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric
                        spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
                                formed at the axis of the cheese.</p>
                    <p>
                        Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the
                        paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
                        heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a
                        hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp
                        slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
                        ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more
                        pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient
                        to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity
                        too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
                        subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
                        means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give
                        it compactness and gloss.</p>
                        <p>
                        Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
                        splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and
                        hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
                        arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
                        to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat,
                        in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off
                        the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the
                        whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to
                        the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.
                        Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
                        As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
                        somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in
                        stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire
                        morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it
                        downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to
                        free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
